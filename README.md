# dev-env
Single source of knowledge of configuring development environment for a specific programming languages and frameworks

## Why?
On the way to my Software Development journey, I feel that I am not and I do not want to get too much comfortable with any specific programming language (at least at the time of writing this).
Just like many people, I used to torture myself finding out one single 'nirvana' language (to rule them all). Later I realized that, I don't want to be an advocate of using <insert_your_language_of_choice>.
There are way too much good options available for almost every section of Software Design and Development. I want to build staff that people may find useful. I also want to build staff that I would love 
to pay for it. I have always a 'fantasy' of working on a large scale systems since my undergrad days, which is still yet to be true. All of these make me tinker about various technologies and 
programming languages. I want to be proficient in multiple programming languages. And I would like to have a guideline on my own when I set up developmnent environment to work with a new programming 
language, which is the inspiration of this repo so that when I need to jump on a specific language after a while, or change my dev-machine, I can install/reinstall staffs to set up programming environment
quickly.
